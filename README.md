## Development Build
Development Build: A development build is meant for local development and testing. It is optimized for fast builds and easy debugging, and may include features like hot reloading and source maps. The goal of a development build is to make it easy for developers to work on the code and rapidly iterate on changes. The importance of development builds lies in providing a smooth development experience to the developers, which in turn improves productivity and reduces development time.

To produce a development build:
```
npm run dev
```
This will generate a development build.
